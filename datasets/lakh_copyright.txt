Trad: What Do You Do With a Drunken Sailor?

1996, Mark Johnson, 102334.12@compuserve.com

Copyright 1996. All rights reserved . . . 

Distribution and reproduction permitted for 
non-commercial purposes, only.


Just the traditional little ditty, with a few sound effects
thrown in at the beginnng to suggest (barely, I'll admit)
an old sailing ship plowing some moderately heavy
seas.

Hope you like it. And besides, is it really so bad to sail
forever the 7 seas, as the waves wash the deck, trapped
in a MIDI and just singing a jig? (what do you do wi . . .)

Trad: What Do You Do With a Drunken Sailor?

1996, Mark Johnson, 102334.12@compuserve.com

Copyright 1996. All rights reserved . . . 

Distribution and reproduction permitted for 
non-commercial purposes, only.


Just the traditional little ditty, with a few sound effects
thrown in at the beginnng to suggest (barely, I'll admit)
an old sailing ship plowing some moderately heavy
seas.

Hope you like it. And besides, is it really so bad to sail
forever the 7 seas, as the waves wash the deck, trapped
in a MIDI and just singing a jig? (what do you do wi . . .)
